netlify env:set R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY "your_secret_access_key"
netlify env:set R2_BUCKET_NAME "your_bucket_name"
netlify env:set R2_PUBLIC_URL "your_public_url" # Optional
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Netlify

1. Commit and push your code to your Git repository
2. Trigger a new deploy:
   - [ ] Using Netlify UI: Push the deploy button in your site settings
   - [ ] Using Git: Push to your connected branch
   - [ ] Using CLI: Run `netlify deploy --prod`

## Step 4: Verify Deployment

- [ ] Visit your deployed site (check Netlify domain)
- [ ] Create a test post with media files
- [ ] Verify files upload to R2:
  - Check [R2 Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) → R2 section
  - You should see a `posts/` folder with your uploads
- [ ] Verify files display on the site:
  - [ ] Images show in lightbox when clicked
  - [ ] Videos play with controls and fullscreen button
  - [ ] Media thumbnails appear in the grid
  - [ ] Download buttons work
  - [ ] Navigation between media works

## Step 5: Test Media Features

### Image Lightbox

- [ ] Click an image in the post detail page
- [ ] Image opens in fullscreen modal
- [ ] Can navigate with arrow buttons
- [ ] Can download with download button
- [ ] Close button (X) works
- [ ] Clicking outside closes the modal

### Video Fullscreen

- [ ] Click fullscreen icon on video player
- [ ] Video enters fullscreen mode
- [ ] All video controls work (play, pause, volume, progress)
- [ ] Close button (X) closes fullscreen
- [ ] Video thumbnail appears in grid

### Media Gallery

- [ ] Can click any thumbnail to view in preview
- [ ] Navigation arrows work smoothly
- [ ] Media counter shows current position
- [ ] File information displays correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No Posts Found" after deployment

- [ ] Check environment variables are set in Netlify (not in .env)
- [ ] Redeploy after setting variables
- [ ] Check that R2_BUCKET_NAME matches the actual bucket name

### Issue: Media uploads but doesn't display

- [ ] Verify R2_PUBLIC_URL is correct (if set)
- [ ] Check R2 bucket has public read access (if needed)
- [ ] Verify the media URL in browser DevTools
- [ ] Check R2 bucket in Cloudflare dashboard for uploaded files

### Issue: Video doesn't play

- [ ] Check video format is supported (MP4, WebM, MOV, AVI, MKV, etc.)
- [ ] Verify video file uploaded correctly to R2
- [ ] Test with a smaller/different video file
- [ ] Check browser console for CORS errors

### Issue: Upload fails with permission error

- [ ] Verify R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID and R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY are correct
- [ ] Check API token has Write and Delete permissions
- [ ] Verify token hasn't expired
- [ ] Check R2 bucket exists
